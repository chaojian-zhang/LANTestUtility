# LAN Test Utility

A super simple and light weight C# HTTP Server (using .Net Framework 4.6 class library) that serves a single webpage in local area network.

# Motivation

Once in a while when I try to play *Unreal Tournament* or *ICT Zombies* with my roommate it turns out we cannot find each other **even though we are under the same network** (Bell home internet). After some trouble it becomes evident changing a router (e.g. using a customly purchased *TPLink Archer* instead of provided *Bell HomeHub 300*) can solve the problem. In such circumstances it's necessary to have some utility tool that is **known to be simple enough to work in LAN environment** thus we can quickly rule out the possibility that it's the program itself (e.g. *Unreal Tournament* is no longer maintained so we might expect it to just "no longer function in LAN") that's not working - but rather turn our attention to the **network itself**.
