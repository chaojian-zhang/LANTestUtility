        <h3>LAN Test Utility</h3>

        <p>Ask your friends to visit <a href="{{Address}}">{{Address}}</a> in their browsers (use Windows command `ipconfig` for more available IP address options).</p>
        <p>If they cannot see this page, consider one of the following (in order of relevance - latter items are less relevant): </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You might need to TURN OFF (yes, turn off completely instead of mess with inbound/outbound rules) Windows Firewalls. 
                This is inside <strong>Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall\Customize Settings</strong>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Notice surprising enough, even if you are pretty darn sure you are on a <em>Private Network</em>, you might need to turn off
                        <em>Public Network</em> firewall for it to work. Hopefully that's all there is to hurdle your connection within your LAN.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Notice only the host needs to turn off firewall, and all peers usually don't need to change any network configuration on their side.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For specific ways to configure Firewall instead of turning it off completely, see relevant discussion here: <a href="https://community.logmein.com/t5/LogMeIn-Hamachi-Discussions/inbound-traffic-block-check-firewall-settings/td-p/134361">Hamachi Inbound Connection</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The interconnection between arbitary machines might not be permitted within your current network;
            </li>
            <li>
                Your computer might not be discoverable on the network (e.g. you are running Windows in a public instead of private network):
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Check <strong>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings</strong> for <em>Network Sharing</em> options.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Otherwise, there are configuration issues with your <strong>network router</strong> and it's beyond what this program can do.
            Try things like <em>"Port Forwarding"</em> among other solutions. (Most likely the router just doesn't allow LAN connection,
            consider using a different router)
            <br />
            In particular, if none of the games you have can be played in LAN mode, then you need to figure out how to
            replace/setup your router - and it might be related to ISP specific routers. Good luck!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <em>P.S.</em> Worth noting though, as mentioned in <em>Point 1</em> above - for some reason I don't know yet, even if ISP's router doesn't seem to work
            with Port Forwarding and switching a router (e.g. change from Bell HomeHub 3000 to TP-Link Archer, without changing any other configuration on the program)
            seems to solve the problem - in the former case by turning off Windows Firewall it can also solve the problem (i.e. even with original Bell HomeHub 3000 router!). 
            <strong>Anyone more informed in this subject might be interested in adding why to this page.</strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <em>P.S.</em> In other cases, consider using a VPN network application like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogMeIn_Hamachi">LogMeIn Hamachi</a> to establish LAN
            connections between different devices. Or if you have a better open source alternative, please <strong>don't hesitate to </strong>
            <a href="mailto:charles@totalimagine.com">email me</a> and I will update the recommendation on this page.
